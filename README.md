Modular Architecture: A decoupled design with a Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend, allowing for easy scaling and maintenance.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### Backend
Spring Boot: The core framework for the RESTful API.

Java 17: The programming language used for the backend.

1. Backend Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the pollyglot-backend directory.

Open src/main/resources/application.properties and add your Hugging Face API token:

Properties

huggingface.api.token=hf_YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN

Run the application from your IDE or using the following Maven command:

./mvnw spring-boot:run

The backend will start on http://localhost:8080.

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the pollyglot-frontend directory.

Install the npm dependencies:
npm install

Start the Angular development server:
ng serve

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Usage
Ensure both the backend (http://localhost:8080) and the frontend (http://localhost:4200) are running.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200.

Enter the text you wish to translate into the text area.

Select a target language using the radio buttons.

Click the "Translate" button to see the translated text.
